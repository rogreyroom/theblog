# TheBlog

It is a simple blog app that displays posts from <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com> API. It displays the list of posts, lets the user go to the post page to see the single post as well as reads all comments related to it. Users can also write a comment and send it to the API, json placeholder has an endpoint to simulate the response. Users also can mark the post as a favorite and it will be saved to the local storage with the use of redux persist.
